# Train Scheduler
A Firebase application that provides up-to-date information about (fictional) train times and schedules.

Please checkout out the deployed app on Firebase [here]( https://trainscheduler-1438d.firebaseapp.com/)!

The layout of the page is done in `Bootstrap` and the functionality utilizes `jQuery` and `Moment.js` to append trains in chronological order. All data is persistent using the `Firebase API`.
